# PHP Bagiwi

PHP Bagiwi [bah-gi-whi _or_ /b…ô'gi:'wi:/] (like kiwi, but with a G). Acronym to PHP BAsh GIt WIndows, aimed at making it
easier to use and maintain PHP versions under MingW (or other Bash-compatible systems, like CygWin).

Because many developers need to work on many versions, and may occasionally want to try new versions, this set tools
should give you enough flexibility to work with the many versions.

<u>**CAUTION**</u> currently this is only aimed on <u>Stable</u> builds of php, using a predefined URL, only filling in
the PHP version of your choice and architecture (32 or 64 bit) .

Only the NTS (non-thread safe or single-thread) versions (which is enough for CLI actions)

This may also work under Linux or other Unix and Linux systems, but no guarantees.

Written in Bash script. My knowledge of Bash may be limited, so use the shorter or better version where
applicable, just remember it's for Windows, not n*x OSses.

# Prerequisites

Either install GIT-SCM or MingW. CygWin is also a good choice, but it's initially aimed towards the bash CLI shipped
with GIT-SCM (#1 choice for GIT on Windows).

If you don't, the current package may prove VERY difficult to run :)

# Work In Progress

This project is far from ready for the real world. I only have a few directions in place where I want this project to
go.

If you want to help, just fork and go. :)
